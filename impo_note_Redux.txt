How to plan for the redux 

- what actions to create
- what will be the inital state 
- how will be the reducer 
- Is it Async Actions 
- How to dispatch the action  

****** React redux ********* 

process: 
- created "redux" folder, 
- created 'action', 'reducer', 'store' subfolder  
- imported 'Provider' from 'react-router' and provided 'store' 

    code: 
        <Provider store={store}> 
            <App/> 
        </Provider/>  

- installed react-devtools-extension 
- imported in store and applied. 

    code: 
    import {composeWithDevTools} from 'react-devtools-extension'; 

    const store = createStore(notesReducer, composeWithDevTools()); 
 
- importing useSelector and useDispatch from 'react-redux'; 
- useSelector(callbackfunc) - useSelector takes callback function which takes the store as a parameter. for example: 
    code: 
    useSelector(store => {store.notes});  

- useDispatch hook is used to dispatch the action creator
